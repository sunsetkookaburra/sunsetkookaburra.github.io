Hello, Blog!

Why start a blog? Because why not!
Starting a blog is a quirky experience.

Here is the obligatory meta-analysis:
Did not like english in school, hated writing.


## Background

* Setting up a place to write about power meter project - if i go to the effort to write up one project, why not setup the infrastructure .
* Hard to be spontaneous - perfectionist and worry about writing 'fake' or planned stuff that isn't off the cuff.
* but here i am after editing

## Backblaze B2



## Zola Templates



## Git Repository



## Cloudflare Pages



* Cloudflare pages setup
* backblaze b2 backend
* migrate from github pages
* cloudflare vs gh-pages approach

## Font Subset

## Caching and Backblaze B2

* Heiarchy of Cloudflare Edge-Cache TTL
* Backblaze (no default Cache-Control max-age)
* ^^ Above may cause strange Class B transactions (downloads of the files, despite via url)
* Cloudflare Edge TTL Value
* Cloudflare Browser TTL Value
* Minimum TTL values for plans
